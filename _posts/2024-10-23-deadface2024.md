This is a writeup for some challenges from Deadface CTF 2024. This was also my very first CTF and writeup so the explanations might be super scuffed. With hindsight, the challenges were actually pretty simple but I guess everyone starts from the bottom.

## Cereal Killer 01 [Cereal Killer]
Description: This year, America's politicians are weighing in on the IMPORTANT issues... As in, which spooky cereal is best? Mr. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has a favorite spooky cereal. Tear apart this binary and see if you can figure out what it is!

Flag: `flag{The-M0st-Fam0us-Nephew-Loves-B00B3rry!}`

We given a program that appears to be a simple password checker and data processing application. The user is prompted to enter a password, which is then processed and compared against a stored value to grant or deny access to certain functionality.

After decompile the program with [dogbolt](https://dogbolt.org/) i found something interesting

### Key and Functions
1. Function: sub_123d
Purpose: Trims whitespace from the beginning and end of a given string.
2. Function: sub_12e3
Purpose: Converts hexadecimal characters into their integer equivalents. The function recognizes:
Characters '0'-'9' as values 0-9.
Characters 'A'-'F' as values 10-15.
Characters 'a'-'f' as values 10-15.
3. Function: sub_133f
Purpose: Takes a hexadecimal string and converts it to binary, storing the result in a specified buffer.
4. Function: sub_13ec
Purpose: Performs a character transformation. If a character is lowercase, it shifts its ASCII value by a specified amount (0xD or 13 in decimal).

### Main Logic of the Program
1. The program prompts the user to enter a password.
2. It checks the user-provided password against a hardcoded value stored in the variable var_564, which contains the string "obboreel".
3. If the transformed user input matches the hardcoded string, access is granted.
4. Upon successful verification, another transformation occurs, which ultimately reveals the hidden flag.

### Understading the Transformation
The function shifts each character in the input password by 0xd positions. For example, 'o' (ASCII 111) would become 'z' (ASCII 122).
Thus, to reverse this, we would need to shift each character back by 13.
- 'o' (ASCII 111) -> 'b' (ASCII 98) (shift -13)
- 'b' (ASCII 98) -> 'o' (ASCII 111) (shift -13)
- 'b' (ASCII 98) -> 'o' (ASCII 111) (shift -13)
- 'o' (ASCII 111) -> 'b' (ASCII 98) (shift -13)
- 'r' (ASCII 114) -> 'e' (ASCII 101) (shift -13)
- 'e' (ASCII 101) -> 'r' (ASCII 114) (shift -13)
- 'e' (ASCII 101) -> 'r' (ASCII 114) (shift -13)
- 'l' (ASCII 108) -> 'y' (ASCII 121) (shift -13)
The required input password becomes `booberry`

For the final execution will go like this
```

## Missing Piece
Description: We found this code from deephax that looks like it was built to hide a flag using some form of cryptography. The program is missing code that will reveal the flag. Try to fix the program and submit the flag.

Flag: `flag{f1n1sh_Th3_c0d3}`

C Code are provided in this challenge
```
# include <stdio.h>
# include <string.h>

const char *hex_string = "b52195a4a82bc5ade23e9c9c8725c79cb07d90f0ae";  // The hex string for the flag
const char *key = "d34df4c3";

int hex_char_to_int(char c) {
    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') return c - '0';
    if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'f') return c - 'a' + 10;
    if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'F') return c - 'A' + 10;
    return -1;
}

void hex_string_to_bytes(const char *hex, unsigned char *bytes, size_t length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        bytes[i] = (hex_char_to_int(hex[i * 2]) << 4) | hex_char_to_int(hex[i * 2 + 1]);
    }
}

void xor_bytes(unsigned char *data, size_t data_length, const unsigned char *key, size_t key_length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < data_length; ++i) {
        data[i] ^= key[i % key_length];
    }
}

int main() {
    size_t flag_length = strlen(hex_string) / 2;
    unsigned char flag[flag_length];
    unsigned char key_bytes[4];

    // Convert hex string to bytes
    hex_string_to_bytes(hex_string, flag, flag_length);
    hex_string_to_bytes(key, key_bytes, 4);

    xor_bytes(flag, flag_length, key_bytes, 4);

    // Print the result as a string
    printf("Resulting string: ");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < flag_length; ++i) {
        printf("%c");
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```

And it looks like trying to convert a hexadecimal string to bytes, XOR those bytes with a key, and then print the resulting string. However, in the that already provided, the `printf` statement in the main function does not print the characters correctly because you’re missing the correct argument for `%c`. Additionally, the size of the `key_bytes` array could be defined as a constant instead of hardcoding it. Here is the corrected code:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

const char *hex_string = "b52195a4a82bc5ade23e9c9c8725c79cb07d90f0ae";  // The hex string for the flag
const char *key = "d34df4c3";
const size_t key_length = 4;  // Length of the key in bytes

int hex_char_to_int(char c) {
    if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') return c - '0';
    if (c >= 'a' && c <= 'f') return c - 'a' + 10;
    if (c >= 'A' && c <= 'F') return c - 'A' + 10;
    return -1;
}

void hex_string_to_bytes(const char *hex, unsigned char *bytes, size_t length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
        bytes[i] = (hex_char_to_int(hex[i * 2]) << 4) | hex_char_to_int(hex[i * 2 + 1]);
    }
}

void xor_bytes(unsigned char *data, size_t data_length, const unsigned char *key, size_t key_length) {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < data_length; ++i) {
        data[i] ^= key[i % key_length];
    }
}

int main() {
    size_t flag_length = strlen(hex_string) / 2;
    unsigned char flag[flag_length];
    unsigned char key_bytes[key_length];

    // Convert hex string to bytes
    hex_string_to_bytes(hex_string, flag, flag_length);
    hex_string_to_bytes(key, key_bytes, key_length);

    // XOR the flag with the key
    xor_bytes(flag, flag_length, key_bytes, key_length);

    // Print the resulting bytes as a string
    printf("Resulting string: ");
    for (size_t i = 0; i < flag_length; ++i) {
        printf("%c", flag[i]);  // Correctly print each byte as a character
    }
    printf("\n");

    return 0;
}
```
After run with [online compiler](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/online-compiler/) it will print the flag
```
Resulting string: flag{f1n1sh_Th3_c0d3}
```

## Winning Factors
Description: As another test of your programming prowess, Turbo Tactical wants to see if you can write a script to solve mathematic equations being served by a remote server within 3 seconds.
`147.182.245.126:33001`

Flag: `flag{1ntr0_f4ct0r14l_5t3p}`

We are given remote server that which requires us to solve the factorial problem within 3 seconds
```
─ ~ ───────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  4m 10s  14:43:01 ─╮
╰─ nc 147.182.245.126 33001                                           ─╯
Calculate the factorial of {random-number}.
Too slow!%
```
To solve the problem of calculating the factorial of a random number within 3 seconds, we can use Python's `socket` library to connect to the remote server, and `math.factorial` to compute the factorial quickly. 
Here's a Python script that connects to the remote service, reads the random number, calculates the factorial, and sends the result back within the time limit.
```
import socket
import re
import math

def solve_factorial_challenge():
    # Server connection details
    host = '147.182.245.126'
    port = 33001
    
    # Connect to the server
    with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
        s.connect((host, port))

        # Receive data from the server
        data = s.recv(1024).decode()

        # Look for the factorial number in the received message using regex
        match = re.search(r'Calculate the factorial of (\d+)', data)
        if match:
            # Extract the number from the message
            number = int(match.group(1))
            print(f"Received number: {number}")

            # Calculate the factorial
            result = math.factorial(number)

            # Send the result back to the server
            s.sendall(str(result).encode())

            # Receive response from the server
            response = s.recv(1024).decode()
            print(f"Server response: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":

currently the host arent active, so i cant provide the result lol.

## SkyWave 1: High Tower [Skywave]
Description: We need your help tracking down d34th, the leader of DEADFACE. He recently conducted an attack against SkyWave Telecommunications. We’ve received cell tower data that might help us pinpoint d34th’s device and potentially lead us to his identity. But first, we need to assess your familiarity with SQL and the data you’re being provided. What is the tower_id of the cell tower that sits at an approximate elevation of 220 ft?

Flag: `flag{215}`

We are give access to the database via `SSH` at `skywave.deadface.io` with this credential
```
Username: skywave
Password: d34df4c3
```

After looking for the Tower tables, we can `WHERE` and `BETWEEN` SQL Query to find the tower that approximate elevation of 220 ft.
```
MySQL [cell_tower_db]> SELECT * FROM Towers WHERE elevation BETWEEN 215 AND 225;
+----------+---------------+-----------+------------+-----------+--------------+-------------+--------+--------------+-----------------------+
| tower_id | location_name | latitude  | longitude  | elevation | tower_height | operator_id | status | install_date | last_maintenance_date |

7 rows in set (0.001 sec)
```

Then we found the tower id `215` with elevation `220.32` close with 220.

## SkyWave 2: Trifecta [Skywave]
Description: We can assume that d34th used some kind of smart device or computer to conduct his attacks. How many devices in the database are either a smart phone, a computer, or a tablet?

Flag: `flag{714}`

Like the previous challenge, in this challenge we are required to calculate the total number of devices from the `Devices` table whose type is `computer`, `smartphone`, or `tablet` based on information taken from the `Device_Types` table.
```
MySQL [cell_tower_db]> SELECT COUNT(d.device_id) FROM Devices d JOIN Device_Types dt ON d.device_type_id=dt.device_type_id where dt.device_type_name IN ("computer", "smartphone", "tablet");
+--------------------+
| COUNT(d.device_id) |
+--------------------+
|                714 |
+--------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

### Query Explanation
1. `SELECT COUNT(d.device_id)`:
This will count the number of rows (devices) in the `Devices` table that match the condition in the `WHERE` section. `d.device_id` is a unique identifier for each device, so `COUNT(d.device_id)` counts the number of matching devices.

2. `FROM Devices d`:
This section refers to the `Devices` table with the alias `d`. This means that the `Devices` table will be referred to as `d` throughout the query.

3. `JOIN Device_Types dt ON d.device_type_id = dt.device_type_id`:
This is an inner join between the `Devices` table (`d`) and the `Device_Types` table (`dt`). This join connects the two tables based on the `device_type_id` column that exists in both tables (`d.device_type_id = dt.device_type_id`). This means that only rows that have a match in both tables will be included in the result.

4. `WHERE dt.device_type_name IN ("computer", "smartphone", "tablet")`:
This condition ensures that only devices that have a device type with the name "computer", "smartphone", or "tablet" will be counted. The `device_type_name` column in the `Device_Types` table (`dt`) is compared against the three values ​​given in the `IN` clause.

## SkyWave 4: Longest Run [Skywave]
Description: We need to determine which device had the longest running connection out of the towers with the following coordinates:
> (41.639642, -79.220682)
> (40.598271, -78.801089)
> (41.045892, -79.068358)
> (41.257279, -77.529468)
Additionally, let’s focus on only finding the longest running connection with a dBm greater than -100.

Flag: `flag{845303290931675}`

In this challenge, we just need to search for the IMEI of devices connected to a particular telecommunications tower, with a strong signal, and sorted by the longest connection duration. Here are the query i used to find it
```
MySQL [cell_tower_db]> SELECT D.device_imei FROM Connections C JOIN Towers T ON C.tower_id = T.tower_id JOIN Devices D ON C.device_id = D.device_id   WHERE T.latitude IN (41.639642, 40.598271, 41.045892, 41.257279)   AND T.longitude IN (-79.220682, -78.801089, -79.068358, -77.529468)   AND C.signal_strength > -100   ORDER BY C.connection_duration DESC LIMIT 1;
+-----------------+
| device_imei     |
+-----------------+
| 845303290931675 |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.004 sec)
```

### Query Explanation
This query is used to find the **IMEI** (International Mobile Equipment Identity) of devices connected to a particular telecommunications tower, with a strong signal, and sorted by the longest connection duration. Here is an explanation of each part:

1. `SELECT D.device_imei`:
This extracts the `IMEI` value from the device. The `device_imei` column is in the `Devices` table, and the query result will display the IMEI of devices that meet the specified conditions.

2. `FROM Connections C`:
The `Connections` (aka `C`) table contains data about connections between devices and telecommunications towers. The query starts by selecting data from this table.

3. `JOIN Towers T ON C.tower_id = T.tower_id`:
This is an inner join** between the `Connections` (C) and `Towers` (T) tables. The `Towers` table contains information about telecommunication towers, and the relationship between the `Connections` and `Towers` tables is connected through the `tower_id` column. This means that the connections involved will only include connections to towers that are in the `Towers` table.

4. `JOIN Devices D ON C.device_id = D.device_id`:
This is an inner join between the `Connections` table (C) and the `Devices` table (D), using the `device_id` column. This associates a particular connection with the associated device, so that we can get details about the device, such as `device_imei`.

5. `WHERE T.latitude IN (41.639642, 40.598271, 41.045892, 41.257279)`:
This condition filters telecommunication towers (`Towers`) based on the **latitude** coordinates. Only towers that have **latitude** between the four given values ​​(41.639642, 40.598271, 41.045892, 41.257279) will be included in the results.

6. `AND T.longitude IN (-79.220682, -78.801089, -79.068358, -77.529468)`:
This condition filters towers based on `longitude`. Only towers that have **longitude** between the four given values ​​(-79.220682, -78.801089, -79.068358, -77.529468) will be included in the results.

7. `AND C.signal_strength > -100`:
This condition filters connections based on **signal strength**. Only connections with signal strength greater than **-100 dBm** will be included. The signal is stronger if the value is closer to zero.

8. `ORDER BY C.connection_duration DESC`:
The query results are sorted by `connection_duration` (`connection_duration`) from longest to shortest, using `DESC` (descending).

9. `LIMIT 1`:
This limits the query results to only one row, which is the connection with the longest duration that matches all of the above conditions.

So, This query retrieves the `IMEI` of devices connected to one of four telecommunication towers specified by `latitude` and `longitude` coordinates, only if the connection signal is stronger than -100 dBm. The results are sorted by the longest connection duration, and only `one` device with the longest connection duration is retrieved.

## SkyWave 9: Updates [Skywave]
Description: How many towers received software updates?

Flag: `flag{70}`

In this challenge, we are required to create a query that will be used to count the unique number of telecommunications towers undergoing maintenance with the type `software update`. Here are query i used to find that
```
MySQL [cell_tower_db]> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tower_id) AS updated_tower_count FROM Tower_Maintenance WHERE maintenance_type LIKE '%software update%';
+---------------------+
| updated_tower_count |
+---------------------+
|                  70 |
+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.001 sec)
```

### Query Explanation
1. `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tower_id)`:
The `COUNT(DISTINCT tower_id)` function counts the number of **uniques** from the `tower_id` column. `tower_id` is the ID that represents each telecommunications tower. By using `DISTINCT`, the query ensures that only distinct towers are counted, so if there is more than one maintenance event on the same tower, it will only be counted once.

2. `AS updated_tower_count`:
This section gives the result an alias name, namely `updated_tower_count`. This is the name of the column that will appear in the query results and represents the number of unique towers that have undergone maintenance.

3. `FROM Tower_Maintenance`:
The query retrieves data from the `Tower_Maintenance` table, which stores tower maintenance information. This table likely contains details such as tower ID (`tower_id`), maintenance type, date, and other details about the maintenance activity.

4. `WHERE maintenance_type LIKE '%software update%'`:
The `WHERE` clause filters the rows in the table based on the maintenance type. In this case, the query only considers rows where the `maintenance_type` column contains the words **"software update"** anywhere in the text (using the `LIKE` operator and the **`%`** wildcard). The `%` wildcard allows matching any text before or after the phrase "software update".

So, this query counts and returns the number of telecommunication towers undergoing maintenance involving `software update`, ensuring that each tower is counted only once even though there may be multiple maintenances on the same tower.

### Payload Explanation
The payload `admin' or '1'='1:admin' or '1'='1` is a classic form of SQL Injection that uses boolean logic to manipulate SQL queries executed by a web application.
