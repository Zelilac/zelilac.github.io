This writeup was still made even though only a few challenges could be completed.

## Direction [WEB]
Description: Something seems off with the plan displayed on this site. Can you uncover what's hidden behind the scenes and find the way out? The Professor always has a trick up his sleeve.

Link: 
> https://questcon-misdirect.chals.io

Flag: `QUESTCON{mi3d1r3ct10n_15_4n_4r}`

In this challenge, we are given a link but when it is opened or accessed using `curl` there is an alert as follows
```
╭─ ~ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  05:44:59 ─╮
╰─ curl https://questcon-misdirect.chals.io/                                 ─╯
You are being misdirected!
```

After digging further, i found something interesting in `robots.txt`
```
╭─ ~ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  05:45:03 ─╮
╰─ curl https://questcon-misdirect.chals.io/robots.txt                       ─╯
User-agent: *
Disallow: /start
```

Tried to explore deeper into `/start` and finally found the flag part in the HTTP header `X-Flag-Part` also the location of the next part in `Location`
```
╭─ ~ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  05:52:36 ─╮
╰─ curl -i https://questcon-misdirect.chals.io/start -X POST                  ─╯

HTTP/1.1 302 Found
X-Powered-By: Express
Location: /redirect0
X-Flag-Part: QUESTC
Date: Tue, 29 Oct 2024 22:52:40 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
Keep-Alive: timeout=5
Content-Length: 0
```

### Exploitation
After knowing the steps above, I wrote python code to automate taking the flag parts and putting them together.
```
import requests

# Starting URL
url = "https://questcon-misdirect.chals.io/start"
flag_parts = []

# Create a session to automatically handle cookies and redirections
session = requests.Session()

# Make an initial POST request to start the redirect chain
response = session.post(url, allow_redirects=False)

while True:
    # Extract the X-Flag-Part from the headers and print it
    if 'X-Flag-Part' in response.headers:
        part = response.headers['X-Flag-Part']
        flag_parts.append(part)
        print("Found flag part:", part)
    
    # Follow the redirect if it exists, otherwise break out
    if 'Location' in response.headers:
        next_url = response.url.rsplit('/', 1)[0] + response.headers['Location']
        response = session.get(next_url, allow_redirects=False)
    else:
        break

# Join the collected flag parts
flag = ''.join(flag_parts)
print("\nFull Flag:", flag)
```
Then the output will go like this
```

╰─ python3 Direction.py                                                       ─╯
Found flag part: QUESTC
Found flag part: ON{mi3
Found flag part: d1r3ct
Found flag part: 10n_15
Found flag part: _4n_4r

Full Flag: QUESTCON{mi3d1r3ct10n_15_4n_4r
```

### Explanation
1. Initial Request (POST)
- We start the redirection process by sending a `POST` request to the initial URL `/start`.
- `allow_redirects=False`: Sets requests to not automatically follow redirects on this initial request, so we can better manage redirects and collect each part of the flag.

2. Extracting and Printing `X-Flag-Part`
- if `X-Flag-Part` in response.headers: Checks if the `X-Flag-Part` header is present in the current response. If yes, then there is a part of the flag that we need to fetch.
- `part = response.headers[X-Flag-Part]`: Gets the value of the `X-Flag-Part` header and stores it in the part variable.
- `flag_parts.append(part)`: Adds the part value to the `flag_parts` list.
- `print("Found flag part:", part)`: Prints the found flag parts so we can see each part directly.

## Twice The Trouble [Reverse]
Description: The Professor has hidden a secret within a simple number comparison script. Two numbers, a special condition, and a flag locked behind encryption. The trick is to trigger the hidden logic—if you can find it. Solve the puzzle, decrypt the flag, and prove yourself. Can you outsmart the Professor, or will this be twice the trouble?

Flag: `QUESTCON{d0ubl3_tr0ubl3}`

In this Reverse challenge, we are given a python code as follows
```
import math
import random

def xor_encrypt_decrypt(input_str, key):
    return ''.join(chr(ord(c) ^ key) for c in input_str)

def get_flag():
    # XOR-encoded flag
    encoded_flag = [92, 88, 72, 94, 89, 78, 66, 67, 118, 105, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 82, 121, 127, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 112]
    key = 13  # XOR key used for encoding
    flag = ''.join(chr(c ^ key) for c in encoded_flag)
    return flag

# Function to compare the magnitude of two numbers
def compare_numbers(num1, num2):
    if math.sqrt(num1**2) == 2 * abs(num2):
        print("The magnitude of the first number is exactly twice the magnitude of the second!")
        return True
    else:
        print("One of the numbers has a larger magnitude.")
        return False

def main():
    junk = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
    
    try:
        num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

        # Compare numbers and reveal flag if the condition is met
        if compare_numbers(num1, num2):
            print(f"Congratulations! Here's the flag: {get_flag()}")
        else:
            print("Try again with different numbers.")
    
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter valid numbers.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
But when we run the program, the output is
```
╭─ ~ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  06:04:27 ─╮
╰─ python3 twice-the-trouble.py                                               ─╯
Enter the first number: {num}
Enter the second number: {num}
One of the numbers has a larger magnitude.
Try again with different numbers.
```

### Analyze
1. The code is written in Python and appears to be a simple program that asks the user to input two `float` but must meet the following conditions
2. Flag Encoding: The flag is stored in a list of integers, each of which is the result of an `XOR operation` with the key `13`.
```
encoded_flag = [92, 88, 72, 94, 89, 78, 66, 67, 118, 105, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 82, 121, 127, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 112]
key = 13
```
3. XOR Operation: The flag is obtained by XORing each element of the encoded_flag list with the key 13
```
flag = ''.join(chr(c ^ key) for c in encoded_flag)
```
4. Comparison Logic: The `compare_numbers` function compares the magnitudes of two input numbers. It prints a message and returns True if the square root of the first number squared is equal to twice the absolute value of the second number
```
if math.sqrt(num1**2) == 2 * abs(num2):
```

### Exploitation
Since the encoded values are stored in a list, we simply apply the XOR operation with this key to each element, reconstructing the original flag without needing any additional conditions or inputs. This approach bypasses the comparison logic, as it only decodes the flag data directly. Here's the code i wrote to revealing the Flag
```
# Define the encoded flag and the key
encoded_flag = [92, 88, 72, 94, 89, 78, 66, 67, 118, 105, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 82, 121, 127, 61, 120, 111, 97, 62, 112]
key = 13

# Decrypt the flag
def decrypt_flag(encoded_flag, key):
    return ''.join(chr(c ^ key) for c in encoded_flag)

# Print the revealed flag
flag = decrypt_flag(encoded_flag, key)
print("The flag is:", flag)
```
When we run this code, we get the following output:
```
╭─ ~ ────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  4s  05:56:42 ─╮
╰─ python3 twice-the-trouble-sol.py                                           ─╯
The flag is: QUESTCON{d0ubl3_tr0ubl3}
```

## Long Way To Go [Stego]
Description: Something hidden in professor's own quest. Can you find the mole?

Flag: `QUESTCON{d0c5_f1l3s_a3e_N0th1ng_b9t_XM6}`

In this challenge we are given a file in `.docx` format, when I tried to open it it only contained this
![ctf1](/assets/posts/questcon/stego1.png)

However, when exploring and do extract using `binwalk` we get a file containing a flag with the file name `hidden_flag.txt`
```
╭─ ~ ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ✔  06:28:14 ─╮
╰─ binwalk -e long-way-to-go.docx                                                        ─╯
